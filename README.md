# Caesar Hacker

## About

This program can hack messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher from Project 6, even if you don’t know the key. 
There are only 26 possible keys for the Caesar cipher, so a computer can easily try all possible decryptions and 
display the results to the user. In cryptography, we call this technique a brute-force attack. If you’d like to 
learn more about ciphers and code breaking, you can read my book Cracking Codes with Python 
(No Starch Press, 2018; https://nostarch.com/crackingcodes/).
